# Data-Encryption-and-Decryption-Applications-Using-RSA-Algorithm
• RSA Algorithm is a cryptography technique using 2 prime numbers
•The application uses two keys for the data security process, namely the Public 
Keyfor the encryption process and the Private Key for the decryption process
•The strength of this RSA algorithm lies in the exponential process,and the 
afactoring of numbers which until now took a long time to de their factoring.
